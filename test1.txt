As		does			a	fixed	body	of	doctrine	from	a	single	particular	worldview	,	many	anarchist	types	and	traditions	exist	and	varieties	of	anarchy	diverge	widely	.
Classical
Inceptive		among			currents	were	mutualism	and	individualism	.
They		followed			major	currents	of	social	anarchism	(	collectivist	,	communist	and	syndicalist	)	.
They		on			economic	aspects	of	their	ideal	society	.
Mutualism		an			century	economic	theory	that	was	developed	into	anarchist	theory	by	Pierre	-	Joseph	Proudhon	.
Its		include			free	association	,	voluntary	contract	,	federation	,	and	credit	and	currency	reform	that	would	be	regulated	by	a	bank	of	the	people	.
Mutualism		been			as	ideologically	situated	between	individualist	and	collectivist	forms	of	anarchism	.
Proudhon		characterised			as	a	 third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property 	.
Collectivist		,			as	anarchist	collectivism	or	anarcho	-	collectivism	,	is	a	revolutionary	socialist	form	of	anarchism	commonly	associated	with	Mikhail	Bakunin	.
Collectivist		advocate			of	the	means	of	production	,	theorised	to	be	achieved	through	violent	revolution	,	and	that	workers	be	paid	according	to	time	worked	,	rather	than	goods	being	distributed	according	to	need	as	in	communism	.
Collectivist		arose			,	but	rejected	the	dictatorship	of	the	proletariat	despite	the	stated	Marxist	goal	of	a	collectivist	stateless	society	.
Anarcho		communism			known	as	anarchist	-	communism	,	communist	anarchism	and	libertarian	communism	,	is	a	theory	of	anarchism	that	advocates	a	communist	society	with	common	ownership	of	the	means	of	production	,	direct	democracy	,	and	a	horizontal	network	of	voluntary	associations	and	workers		councils	with	production	and	consumption	based	on	the	guiding	principle	:	 From each according to his ability , to each according to his need 	.
Anarcho		communism			radical	socialist	currents	after	the	French	Revolution	,	but	it	was	first	formulated	as	such	in	the	Italian	section	of	the	First	International	.
It		later			in	the	theoretical	work	of	Peter	Kropotkin	.
Anarcho		syndicalism			referred	to	as	revolutionary	syndicalism	,	is	a	branch	of	anarchism	that	views	labour	syndicates	as	a	potential	force	for	revolutionary	social	change	,	replacing	capitalism	and	the	state	with	a	new	society	democratically	self	-	managed	by	workers	.
The		principles			-	syndicalism	are	workers		solidarity	,	direct	action	and	workers		self	-	management	.
Individualist		refers			traditions	of	thought	within	the	anarchist	movement	that	emphasise	the	individual	and	their	will	over	any	kinds	of	external	determinants	.
Early		on			of	anarchism	include	William	Godwin	,	Max	Stirner	and	Henry	David	Thoreau	.
Through		countries			anarchism	attracted	a	small	yet	diverse	following	of	Bohemian	artists	and	intellectuals	as	well	as	young	anarchist	outlaws	in	what	became	known	as	illegalism	and	individual	reclamation	.
Post		classical			.
Anarchist		undergird			social	movements	of	the	left	.
Interest		the			developed	alongside	momentum	in	the	anti	-	globalization	movement	,	whose	leading	activist	networks	were	anarchist	in	orientation	.
As		movement			century	radicalism	,	wider	embrace	of	anarchist	principles	signaled	a	revival	of	interest	.
Contemporary		coverage			black	bloc	demonstrations	has	reinforced	anarchism's	historical	association	with	chaos	and	violence	,	although	its	publicity	has	also	led	more	scholars	to	engage	with	the	anarchist	movement	.
Anarchism		continued			many	philosophies	and	movements	—	at	times	eclectic	,	drawing	upon	various	sources	,	and	syncretic	,	combining	disparate	concepts	to	create	new	philosophical	approaches	.
